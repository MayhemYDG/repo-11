<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `profile_type_id` (String) Specifies the type of profile to query.
- `ref_id` (String) A unique identifier for the query within the list of targets.
In server side expressions, the refId is used as a variable name to identify results.
By default, the UI will assign A->Z; however setting meaningful names may be useful.

### Optional

- `group_by` (List of String) Allows to group the results.
- `hide` (Boolean) true if query is disabled (ie should not be returned to the dashboard)
Note this does not always imply that the query should not be executed since
the results from a hidden query may be used as the input to other queries (SSE etc)
- `label_selector` (String) Specifies the query label selectors. Defaults to "{}".
- `max_nodes` (Number) Sets the maximum number of nodes in the flamegraph.
- `query_type` (String) Specify the query flavor
TODO make this required and give it a default

### Read-Only

- `rendered_json` (String) This datasource rendered as JSON
